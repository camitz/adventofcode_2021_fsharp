# Solution to [https://www.adventofcode.com](Advent of code 2021) in F#.

I'm taking the oportunity to pick up a new skill, namely F#. 

These solutions are correct insofar as they output the correct answer. 

They represent my best attempts so far.
Please comment or PR changes if you ideas about how to make the code neater, faster, friendlier or just better. I look forward to any advice.

I use VS17 but I don't see why it would not work in later versions or VS Code.
